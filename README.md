> An intelligent conversational AI chatbot for exploring the rich history of Pune, India. 🤖

Mastani.ai is a **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG) application designed to answer questions about Pune’s history. It leverages the power of Google's advanced Generative AI models, LangChain for orchestration, and a local ChromaDB vector database for efficient, context-aware information retrieval.

## ✨ Features

  - **Conversational AI Chatbot:** Engage in natural language conversations to ask questions about Pune's history.
  - **Custom Data Retrieval:** Indexes and retrieves data from your own text sources (PDFs) using state-of-the-art embeddings.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with a sleek, dark-themed Gradio UI for an accessible user experience.
  - **Local & Private:** Runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring data privacy and control.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  - **LLM & Embeddings:** Google Generative AI
  - **Framework:** LangChain
  - **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
  - **UI:** Gradio

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to get Mastani.ai up and running on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  - Python 3.9+
  - A Google Generative AI API Key.
  - It is highly recommended to work within a Python virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

### 2\. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deep-khimani/Mastani.ai-A-RAG-Powered-System-for-Historical-Inquiry.git
    cd mastani-ai
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root project directory and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

### 3\. Data Preparation (Required)

**You must run these scripts in order before launching the application.**

1.  **Download Data:** Place your source PDF files (e.g., `pune_history.pdf`) in the `data/` directory.

2.  **Extract Text from PDF (Run first\!):**
    Run the script to convert the source PDF into a text file:

    ```bash
    python scrape_data.py
    ```

    This will create a `data/pune_data.txt` file.

3.  **Ingest Data & Create Vector DB:**
    This script splits the text file into chunks and stores their embeddings in the Chroma vector database.

    ```bash
    python ingest_data.py
    ```

    This will create a `pune_vector_db/` directory.

### 4\. Launch the App

Once the data preparation is complete, you can launch the Gradio web application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). You can now chat with the historical assistant about Pune\!

### Example Questions

  - *Who made Pune the capital during the 18th century?*
  - *Which two rivers meet at the ‘Sangam’ in Pune?*
  - *What is the name of Pune’s oldest area?*
